# Band Together - API

This is the repository for the API of the musician social media platform, Band Together.
This project has mostly been an exercise in building a production-grade application from
scratch by myself in Elixir/Phoenix as a learning experience as well as a portfolio piece.
Also, it might be useful to someone in the world.

## What's Here

The API has all of the database models and interactions (queries, relations, all that) and
will be the future location of all complicated data analysis or really anything interesting
that happens with the logic and interaction of the application components. There is no server-
side rendering or anything happening - this is purely an API and should, with rare exception,
be the only location for management and manipulation of data. Representation should be the
responsibility of the front-end.

## Layout

Mostly, the application currently follows the default Phoenix application structure.
